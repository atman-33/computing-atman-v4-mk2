## When attempting to delete a folder generated by Docker Compose, you may encounter a 'Permission denied' error. 

To resolve this, you can change the permissions for the target folder.
For example, if you want to change the permissions for the 'data/' folder and its contents:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 data/ 
```
